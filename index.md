# About Me

Hi, I'm Karen! I'm a recent graduate from the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/). I currently reside in Seattle, where I work full time and volunteer with [5th Avenue Theatre](https://www.5thavenue.org/), [Pacific Northwest Ballet](https://www.pnb.org/), and a local Girl Scout troop. In my free time, I like to try new cooking recipes, read memoirs, and play the clarinet.
